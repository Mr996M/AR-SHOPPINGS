# AR-SHOPPINGS
The code under this branch realizes a simple supermarket shopping pathfinding system, and uses A* algorithm to complete the shortest path calculation.
The implementation of the algorithm and the connection to the server are implemented in python, while the function of the model or the creation of the map in Unity is implemented in C#.
