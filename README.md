# AR-SHOPPINGS
The code under this branch realizes a simple supermarket shopping pathfinding system, and uses A* algorithm to complete the shortest path calculation.

The implementation of the algorithm and the connection to the server are implemented in python, while the function of the model or the creation of the map in Unity is implemented in C#.

### Unity project presentation matters needing attention
First, enter the Unity project. After that, you need to enter the "server" folder to open a terminal and execute "pyhton server.py" or "python3 server.py" command. Then you'll see the terminal into the initial state as the figure shown below:

Go back to the Unity project and press Play and then the product data, location information as well as map construction for the supermarket project are loaded to the server.
